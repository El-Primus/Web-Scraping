# Web-Scraping
This is a web scraping project
The aim of this project was to download texts, images and tables from a webpage using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.
I loaded the datasciencecourse.org website and scraped it to get the course description.
I scraped the images from skysport report on Ronaldo criticizing France Football Editor over Messi Ballon D'or claim 
The images were named "THE GOATs" and "ROnaldo" respectively.
The scraped tables were the Premiership and La liga tables,  week 14 and 15 respectively
